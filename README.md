#Social Starter Pack
===================

Minimal design starter package for the most popular social media profile images.  No pixel perfect stuff or exact guidelines.

-	Facebook
-	Twitter
-	Google+

.sketch (Sketch 3) files are my priority.  PSD files are coming.

## Notes to my future self


* In my experience, for best results export the twitter header in JPG progressive, also @1.4x size, from the standard 1500x500 size they suggest.

* Sketch 3 rulez hiding and showing layers when exporting stuff, that's why you'll see unified artboards. 

* Be nice
